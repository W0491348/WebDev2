                    <p>I have a background in management, as I was the assistant manager (Manager In Training) at Lush Cosmetics prior to making the decision to change my career path.<br>
                    During my time there, I developed staff to build essential skills in communication, quality customer service, and analyzing business needs.<br>
                    The operational side of business needs is what sparked my desire to change career paths.<br></p>

                    <p>One of the reasons I joined Lush is because I am a huge animal rights advocate. Pictured above is one of my four cats, Chesh.<br>
                    At Lush, being a campaigning company one of our core values was fighting animal testing.<br>
                    Moving into the tech industry, this is still something I will be able to impact.<br>
                    Companies like World Wildlife Fund and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have launched a coalition to end willife trafficking online.<br>
                    This aims to unite the tech industry to make an effort to reduce illegal wildlife trade online.<br>
                    At the top of this page you will find a link to read more about this important movement.</p>
